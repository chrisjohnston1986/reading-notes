- _choosing a text editor ends up being a very personal choice_

## What is a text editor?

- _piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site._

### What features should I look for?

- code completion
- syntax highligting
- nice variety of themes
- ability to choose fom a healthy selection of extension available, when you need them

**Code Completion** 
_Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos. Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the closing of quotation marks when you open them, thus making sure you’re always writing your code._

**Syntax Highlighting** 

_Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read._

## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer?

**Mac computers:** _Text Edit_
**Windows computers:** _Notepad_
