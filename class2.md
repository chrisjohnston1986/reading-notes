[Choosing a Text Editor - The Older Coder](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

> _choosing a text editor ends up being a very personal choice_

## What is a text editor?

> _piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site._

### What features should I look for?

- code completion
- syntax highligting
- nice variety of themes
- ability to choose fom a healthy selection of extension available, when you need them

**Code Completion** 

> _Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos. Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the closing of quotation marks when you open them, thus making sure you’re always writing your code._

**Syntax Highlighting** 

> _Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read._

## Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer?

**Mac computers:** _Text Edit_

**Windows computers:** _Notepad_

**Linux computers:** _Gedit_


> **Usually, the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features.**

***If using text editors on your computer:***

> - _Make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you’re creating code in a plain text editor. You should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic. Plain text has no formatting options. There is no need to bold, underline or italicize code. If you can make your text bold, underlined or italic, then you might need to change a setting somewhere. Please make sure you’re coding in plain text._ 

> - _Also, make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere (maybe on your Desktop, for example) to store your entire website. As you create new documents with the text editor that comes on your computer, save those files in the appropriate folders or sub-folders within the main website folder._ 

> - _Also, please make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names. For example, your main HTML file should be called, “index.html.” Your CSS file should be called something like “style.css.” The filename isn’t as important as the extension (the “.html” and the “.css”)._

## Third-Party Options

- Notepad++
- TextWangler/BB Edit
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Brackets
- Sublime Text

## The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs

> - _A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text. It also manages text, and manages files._

***see above examples***

> - _An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package._

***think "Microsoft Outlook"***
