## How the Web Works
[How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)

&nbsp;

> **Clients and Servers**

&nbsp;

_**Clients** are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome)._

_**Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser._

&nbsp;

> _Imagine that the web is a road. On one end of the road is the client, which is like your house. On the other end of the road is the server, which is a shop you want to buy something from. In addition to the client and the server, we also need to say hello to:_

&nbsp;

-   **Your internet connection:** Allows you to send and receive data on the web. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.

-   **TCP/IP:** Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).

-   **DNS:** Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop so you can access it.

-   **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.

-   **Component files:** A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:

    -   **Code files:** Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.

    -   **Assets:** This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.

## JavaScript Basics
[JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

> _**JavaScript** is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich._

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. 

&nbsp;

**These include:**

-   Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.

-   Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.

-   Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

&nbsp;

## Language Basics Crash Course

&nbsp;

**Variables:** containers that store values.

&nbsp;

- **String:** This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.

- **Number:** This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.

- **Boolean:** This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.

- **Array:** This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.

- **Object:** This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.

&nbsp;

**Comments:** snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments.
