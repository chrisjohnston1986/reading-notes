[CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**_

    - Transform enables the developer to change element properties by setting different properties such; as translate (can relocate where the image is located in the window) and addition (allows animations and transitions to change).

_**Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**_

    - transform:translateY - move a button upwards, add shadow, and a transition. It alters the hover action overtop of a button.

[CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**_

    - Transition, when applied to the parent element will slowly move into the new element property.

_**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**_

    - CSS animation uses keyframes to set breakpoints and change properties frame-by-frame. Transitions move to the new property with a set timer/style applied to how it transitions, such as "ease-in.".

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?**_

    - Transitions bring a website to life. They can modify colors to change slowly, to improve the user experience. Gradual changes are a better experience for the user.

_**How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**_

    - As a full-stack developer, I anticipate that transitions/animations will be utilized in most future projects, within my career path.

# Psychological Safety

[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Five key characteristics of enhanced teams:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- Psychological safety: Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.
Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.

- Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

- Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

- Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.

>***Researchers found that the poorest-performing teams were 100 percent ‘pragmatic’ and had 0 percent ‘relationship-building’ traits.***

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## If you’re right brained:

> _Develop a strategic mindset. Know and understand what drives company to success._

> _Be known for something. Do you have deep expertise in relevant areas? (i.e., financial acumen, scientific expertise or even highly specialized knowledge such as tax law or M&A accounting). Be proactive in mastering them._

> _Practice tackling complex problems. This is especially helpful with those tricky interview questions that Google is famous for. Use those linear thinking skills to your advantage by diving deeply into issues._

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## If you’re left brained:

> _Develop learning agility. Instead of defaulting to the “tried and true” (which pragmatists tend to do), be open to trying varied approaches and new ideas._

> _Find joy in ambiguity. Practice coping with uncertainty and making decisions without having all the information beforehand._

> _Put your social leadership skills to the test. When was the last time you motivated influenced others or deeply connected with your teammates? You might come to find that you actually enjoy it._
