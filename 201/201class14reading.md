[CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**_

    - Transform enables the developer to change element properties by setting different properties such; as translate (can relocate where the image is located in the window) and addition (allows animations and transitions to change).

_**Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**_

    - transform:translateY - move a button upwards, add shadow, and a transition. It alters the hover action overtop of a button.

[CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**_

    - Transition, when applied to the parent element will slowly move into the new element property.

_**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**_

    - CSS animation uses keyframes to set breakpoints and change properties frame-by-frame. Transitions move to the new property with a set timer/style applied to how it transitions, such as "ease-in.".

_**What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?**_

    - Transitions bring a website to life. They can modify colors to change slowly, to improve the user experience. Gradual changes are a better experience for the user.

_**How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**_

    - As a full-stack developer, I anticipate that transitions/animations will be utilized in most future projects, within my career path.
