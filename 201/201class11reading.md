# Readings: Audio, Video, Images

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

[Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**_

    - Dial-up was the king, in the early 2000s. As a result, internet usage was governed by internet speed. Today, most users have access to higher internet speeds today.

_**Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.**_

    - src: the src (source) attribute contains the path to the video you want embedded.

    - controls: the inclusion of a way to start/stop the media, and the ability to make volume adjustments.

_**Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?**_

    -  Paragraphs, inside of a video tag, are called fallback content in the event the browser doesn't support the video.

_**Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.**_

    - This is a short story about two friends named audio and video. Video specialized in displaying pictures with spoken word, while Audio could only speak - absent visual reinforcement. Though different, both excelled at reaching others, to communicate a message.

[A Complete Guide To Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**How does Grid layout differ from Flex?**_

    - Flex changes, due to the content of the container. Grid types must be declared and CSS defines the elements.

_**Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.**_

    - Grid Container: the element on which the grid is applied. Direct parent of all grid items. 

    - Grid Item: the children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.

    - Grid Line: the dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column.

&nbsp;

[Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?**_

    - Images start becoming distorted if you aren't utilizing a vector image. A more responsive site improves user accessibility, across all devices!. 

_**Define the following `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes`. Write an example of how they are used.**_

    - srcset allows for a list of images to the browser can choose a lower quality image for lower network speeds, display types, or sizes. It also allows for a responsive design and a more dynamic page.

    - sizes is the list of varying sizes for an image set. srcset will work with this attribute to determine the best possible browser image sizing.  

_**How is `srcset` more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?**_

    - srcset is more useful because when loading a browser page, it pre-loads all images.
