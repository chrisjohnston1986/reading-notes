[What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**Name some key differences between a `Syntax Error` and a `Logic Error`.**_

    - A syntax error is an error in how the code is written. JavaScript wont run the code, due to the error. Ex, could be: a typo or a missing bracket.
    
    - Logic error will still run, but the result of the code result isn't what was intended. Ex, could be: Using subtraction instead of addition.  

_**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**_

    - ReferenceError, the variable was out of place. 

    - SyntaxErrors, missing brackets/random text in the middle of the code.

    - TypeErrors, input wrong variable as an argument. 

_**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**_

    - Recognition of error type helps expedite the debug process.

[The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**_

    - Debugging tool is similar to an xray, in that you can look at specific points in the code. 

_**Define what a breakpoint is.**_

    - Breakpoints allow the code to run to a point and then pause. This can be used to find errors in your code.  

_**What is the call stack?**_

    - Call stack is the tasks that JS performs. It generates the stack the first time passing through the code, then will add to the stack as it runs a second time.
