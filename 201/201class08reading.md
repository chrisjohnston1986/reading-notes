[Learn CSS - Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**_

    - It changes or moves around the layout, in a single direction, at a time.  

_**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**_

    - the flex-direction property sets the main axis, the cross axis will be the other. I.e., if the row is the main axis, then column would be cross axis.  

_**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**_

    - Certain properties can switch around how something looks visually but not the actual order on the site or page.

_**What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**_

    - It becomes much easier to position and move around elements and containers without the issues of working with floats.  

_**How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**_

    As a personality trait, and a result of my long-term design career, I spend a lot of time trying to work on the front-end presentation, for clients. A lot of the traits of flexbox can be used to facilitate this desire for efficiency and organization.
