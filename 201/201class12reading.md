&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?**_

    - Tables can be difficult to format/build and also have limited search function. Utilizing a chart allows the user to see a graphical representation of the data. 

_**How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**_

    - Plugging data into the API gives a better representation, of the data, than the chart that would be generated by JS.
