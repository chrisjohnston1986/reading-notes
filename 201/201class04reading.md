# Readings: HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Learn HTML

[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**_

    -  The <a> element is wrapped around text to create a hyperlink. 

_**The `href` attribute contains what information?**_

    -  The href or hypertext reference contains the web address.

_**What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**_

    -  If a title's information is truly important to the usability of the page, then you should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users, for example by putting it in the regular text. 

## Learn CSS

[CSS Layout - Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)

[CSS Layout - Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**What is meant by “normal flow”?**_

    -   Normal flow is the C in CSS, cascading, from top to bottom. 

_**What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?**_

    -  A block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it, and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements.

_**`_______` positioning is the default for every html element.**_

    -   Static positioning is the default for every html element. 

_**Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**_

    -  Absolute positioning means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example: popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, etc...

_**What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**_

    -   Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow, instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else.

## Learn JS

[Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

_**Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**_

    -  Declaring a function gives it a name, invoking the function is putting it to use.

_**What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**_

    -  Parameters , these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly Arguments are just another name for parameters.

### Miscellaneous

[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_**Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**_

    -  Greater efficiency and collaboration is a benefit of pair programming. I have already enjoyed some of these advantages, through my 102 class experience - into 201. My accountability team is a huge source of support and I'm grateful for the progress we are ALL collectively making, as we attempt to help each other navigate this path.
