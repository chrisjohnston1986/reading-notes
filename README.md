# My Code Fellows Reading Notes!
*Where I will put all the notes for my reading assignments (hint hint, wink wink).*

Hi, my name is _Chris_. I like music and performing.

Growth mindset is the ability to overcome obstables and persevere.

3 reminders, *which will serve to guide myself*, in keeping the growth mindset:

- **Time is short, keep going!**
- **Trust the process**
- **No one was good when they started learning it.**
