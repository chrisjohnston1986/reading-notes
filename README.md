**About Me**

> _I am a former music educator, from TN. I am married to my partner, Julie (2017), and we reside in Clarksville, TN. I have been teaching since 2011, but grew up in a family of educators, so the environment has been a lifelong presence. In my spare time, I invest a lot of time/effort into coordination/programming/designing pageantry arts performances. These efforts have been mainstay, in my life, since 2005. Due to Covid-19, my previous school system "evolved" my job role, into a Math RTI supplemental position, instead of only music classes. That seemed as good a time as any to look into another path, and I'm here for it :+1: as I've been curious about a potential career shift for quite a while._

**Growth mindset** - _the ability to overcome obstacles and persevere._

A few reminders, *which will serve to guide myself*, in keeping the growth mindset:

- **Time is short, keep going!**
- **Skills are built, not born.**
- **Challenges are chances to grow.** _The more you do, the more you learn._ **Accept opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone.**
