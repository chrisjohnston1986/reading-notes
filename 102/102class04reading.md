##  Wireframe

> _Not dissimilar to an architectural blueprint, a wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, styling, color, and graphics are kept to a minimum. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally, depending on how much detail is required._

> _Wireframing is a practice most commonly used by UX designers. This process allows all stakeholders to agree on where the information will be placed before the developers build the interface out with code._

## Steps to make a Wireframe

&nbsp;

***Do your research!***

&nbsp;

**Before wireframing, understand your audience and analyze similar products.**

> _Prepare research for quick reference._
**Make a 'cheat sheet' with your requirements, and findings from your research.**

> _Map your user flow_
**To limit your own (and your user's) frustration, map out the process of moving through information on a site.**

> _Draft and Sketch_
**Start wireframing! This does not require fine detail, but should represent features and formats. Do not worry about aesthetics or colors, only function.**

&nbsp;

## Things to consider:

> _Organize content to support user goals._
> _Consider which information should be most visible._
> _What will the user *expect* to see on the page?_
> _What touch points does the user need to complete?_
> _Share your wireframe with colleagues, and collaborate._

&nbsp;

## Add detail and start testing

> _Add the skeleton of your site from top to bottom, left to right. Consider the placement of navigation and search tools, keep instructions simple, include tool tips if necessary._

&nbsp;

## Turn Wireframes into prototypes

> _After receiving and utilizing feedback from testing, create your prototype, and continue testing._

&nbsp;

**Tips on making a good Wireframe**
&nbsp;
> _Be clear._ **What is this page for? What can the user do here?**



> _Be confident._ **Use familiar navigational processes, and place items in predictable places.**



> _Simplicity._ **Attractiveness is not a consideration for a wireframe. Keep it simple!**
