##  Wireframe

> _Not dissimilar to an architectural blueprint, a wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. Wireframes provide a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, user flow, functionality, and intended behaviors. As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, styling, color, and graphics are kept to a minimum. Wireframes can be drawn by hand or created digitally, depending on how much detail is required._

> _Wireframing is a practice most commonly used by UX designers. This process allows all stakeholders to agree on where the information will be placed before the developers build the interface out with code._

## Steps to make a Wireframe

&nbsp;

***Do your research!***

&nbsp;

**Before wireframing, understand your audience and analyze similar products.**

> _Prepare research for quick reference._
**Make a 'cheat sheet' with your requirements, and findings from your research.**

> _Map your user flow_
**To limit your own (and your user's) frustration, map out the process of moving through information on a site.**

> _Draft and Sketch_
**Start wireframing! This does not require fine detail, but should represent features and formats. Do not worry about aesthetics or colors, only function.**

&nbsp;

## Things to consider:

> _Organize content to support user goals._
> _Consider which information should be most visible._
> _What will the user *expect* to see on the page?_
> _What touch points does the user need to complete?_
> _Share your wireframe with colleagues, and collaborate._

&nbsp;

## Add detail and start testing

> _Add the skeleton of your site from top to bottom, left to right. Consider the placement of navigation and search tools, keep instructions simple, include tool tips if necessary._

&nbsp;

## Turn Wireframes into prototypes

> _After receiving and utilizing feedback from testing, create your prototype, and continue testing._

&nbsp;

**Tips on making a good Wireframe**
&nbsp;
> _Be clear._ **What is this page for? What can the user do here?**



> _Be confident._ **Use familiar navigational processes, and place items in predictable places.**



> _Simplicity._ **Attractiveness is not a consideration for a wireframe. Keep it simple!**

# Semantics

&nbsp;

> _The term **semantics** refers to the meaning of a piece of code._ 

<br>

**What the code does, or what effect it has.**

<br>

> _In HTML, a header is a semantic element. It emphasises the text inside of the header tags to appear as a header. Any text can be made to look this way by styling, but it will not function correctly without the proper semantics. "HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling." CSS is for presentation._

&nbsp;

## Some examples of semantic elements

_In HTML, these will be represented as tags._

**article, aside, details, footer, header, main, nav, section, summary, and MANY more.**
