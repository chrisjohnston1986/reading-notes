# Basic Syntax

[Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

<br>

## Overview

> _Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown design document._

## Headings

> _To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level._

> _Headings are available in six different sizes, by utilizing the `#` symbol, with the largest using one symbol and the smallest using six._

**Alternate Syntax**

> _Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2._

**Heading Best Practices**

> _Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name. You should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility._

## Paragraphs

> _To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text._

**Paragraph Best Practices**

> _Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs._

## Line Breaks

> _To create a line break or new line, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return._

**Line Break Best Practices**

> _If you were taught to type sentences with two spaces at the end, use **br** instead. For compatibility, do not use a backslash._

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis by making text **bold** or _italic._

**Bold**

> To emphasize by making text **bold**, use two asterisks or two underscores on either side of the text.

> If you need to make letters in the mi**dd**le of a word **bold**, use asterisks for compatibility.

**Italic**

> To emphasize by making text *italic*, use one asterisk or one underscore on either side of the text.
 
> If you need to make letters in the mi*dd*le of a word *italic*, use asterisks for compatibility.


**Bold and Italic**

> To emphasize by making text **bold** and *italic*, use three asterisks or three underscores on either side of the text.

> If you need to make letters in the mi***dd***le of a word ***bold and italic***, use asterisks for compatibility.


## Blockquotes

> _To create a blockquote, add a 'greater than' `>` symbol in front of the text you wish to quote. If your quote has multiple paragraphs, use the `>` symbol on the blank lines between paragraphs._

> _To nest a block quote within another block quote, use two 'greater than' symbols `>>` Other elements such as headings and ordered lists can be used within a block quote._

> _For compatibility, put a blank line before and after block quotes_

**Multiple Paragraphs**

> _Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs._

**Nested Blockquotes**

> _Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest._

**Blockquotes w/other elements**

> _Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work._

**Blockquotes Best Practices**

> _For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes._

## Lists

> _You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists._

**Ordered Lists**

> _To present items in an ordered list, add items on separate lines, preceded by a number and a period. Any number can be used, but the first number **must** be 1!_

> _For compatibility, do not use parentheses for list items._

**Unodered Lists**

> _To present items in an unordered list, add items on separate lines, preceded by a dash `-`, asterisk `*`, or plus sign `+`. These symbols are referred to as 'delimiters'._

> _For compatibility, do not combine delimiters in a single list._

**Adding Elements in Lists**

> _Indent added elements by adding four spaces or one tab. To add **code blocks**, indent eight spaces or two tabs._

## Code

> _Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs._

> _To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks._

**Escaping Backticks**

> _If your text already includes backticks, use double backticks (``)._ 

**Code Blocks**

> _To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab._

## Horizontal Rules

> _To create a horizontal line to separate text, use three asterisks `***`, dashes `---`, or underscores `___`._

**Horizontal Rule Best Practices**

> _For compatibility, put a blank line before and after each horizontal rule._

## Links

> _To create a link, enclose the text for the link in brackets [], followed by the URL in parentheses ()._

**Adding Titles**

> _To add a title to a link (the small box with text that shows when you hover over the text), add your title text in quotation marks after the URL, but still within the parentheses._

**URLs and Email Addresses**

> _To link a URL without text, or link an email address, use angle brackets `<>`._

**Formatting Links**

> _Links can be formatted as bold, italic, or code, just like text._

**Reference Style Links**

> _This style of link, makes URLs easier to read in markdown. The first segment (which is easily readable), makes **reference** to the second segment, the longer URL, which can be embedded anywhere in the markdown._

> _First segment: [URL Reference][label]_
> _Second segment: [label]: <URL> "Optional Title"_

**Links Best Practices**

> _For compatibility, use %20 in place of any spaces in the URL text._

## Images

> _To add an image, use an exclamation mark in parentheses, followed by alt text in brackets, then the image location in parentheses. Optionally, add text in quotation marks for a title._

**Linking Images**

> _To add a link to the image, enclose the image markdown in brackets, then add the link in parentheses._

## Escaping Characters

> _**Escaping characters** refers to displaying characters that are assumed to be part of the markup. Use a backslash to escape a character._

**Characters you can escape**

> _The following may be escaped: \`*{}<>[]()#+-.!|_

## HTML

> _Sometimes, markdown applications allow the use of HTML tags._

**HTML Best Practices**

> _Check your markdown application's documentation!_
