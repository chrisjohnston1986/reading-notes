## What is Version Control?

> _A Version Control is a system that allows the user to share code with others, for multiple developers to work on code simultaneously, review changes to code, and revert a file to a previous version._

**Centralized Version Control:** This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

**Distributed Version Control:** Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines. To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information. Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.

## What is Git?

> _Git is a Distributed Version Control system (DVCS) which is made of of file “snapshots”. It mostly uses local resources, not relying on a server or internet connection. Every change that is made to a file is tracked by Git._
