## Operators

Summarized from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) 

&nbsp;

**Comparison Operators**

> _A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the camparison is true._

&nbsp;

Operands can be: **numerical, string, logical,** or **object values.**

&nbsp;

## Types of Comparison Operators

&nbsp;

> `==` Equal

> `!=` Not equal

> `===` Strict equal

> `!==` Strict not equal

> `>` Greater than

> `>=` Greater than or equal to

> `<` Less than

> `<=` Less than or equal to

&nbsp;

## Assignment Operators

&nbsp;

> An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is `=`, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. 
`x = f()` is an assignment expression that assigns the falue of `f()` to `x`.


&nbsp;

# Loops
Summarized from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

&nbsp;

## For Statements


> A `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

> `for` `([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])`
  `statement` 

  &nbsp;

## While Statements

> A `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`. A `while` statement looks as follows:

&nbsp;

`while` (condition)  
    statement

&nbsp;

> If the `condition` becomes `false`, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

> The condition test occurs *before* `statement` in the loop is executed. If the condition returns `true`, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns `false`, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following `while`.
